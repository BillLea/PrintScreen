I would like to acknowledge the contributions of Mrow Purr and DarkFox127 to my modding.  Without their extensive vidio tutorials this mod would not exist.
I would also like to acknowledge the contribution of uca - EzioTheDeadPoe for showing me the formulas needed to control the menu visibility without using console commands.
Also This mod was developed using Ai code generation. Inclutio the use of Open Ai and Anthropic models.

As near as I can tell it is approiate to issue this work under the terms of the MIT liscens. Just acknowledge me if you use the code.
