I would like to acknologe the comtributions of Mrow Purr and DarkFox127 to my moddikng.  Without their extensive vidio tutorials this mod would not exist.
I would also like to acknologe the contribution of uca - EzioTheDeadPoe for showing me the formulas needed to control the menu visibility without using console commands.

Every one has stated their permission on Nexux for use of their materials. DarkFox and Luca provided Ideas only while Mrow Pur provided ideas and VS CodeVisual Studio contol files to which I made modifications to work with my system.
