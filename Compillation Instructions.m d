Compilation Instructions.
Prepare the requires Construction Ki. While you could use a set of tools previously configured as y9ou like for Skyrim modding I can only discuss my setup.
You will need the game and the Construction kit . I assume you know how to set that up.  if not refer to Mrow Purr's Skyrim Scripting tutorials. Only keep in mind that the new CK is not compatable: you will need to install Construction Kit Platform Extended mod from the NEXUS.  This is mandatory because CK will hang on exit if the mod is not installed.
Install MO2.  The control files expect the MO2 mod folder to be in Modding/MO2/Mods. If you have the MO2 files elsewhere you will need to change the control files.

Install visual studio code according to Mrow Purrs instruction in Skyrim Scripting series.  This is still current. 

Install visual studio if you don't already have it.  The free version is adaquate.

Install Cmake and Vcpkg. Once again MrowPurr has accurate information in Skyrim Scripting video tutorials. Be sure and set the appropriate environment variables. 

Clone the printscreenv4 repository from GitHub. Enter the repository and you will find Two directoried one containing the Papyrus scripts and one containing the C++ code. edit the control files to pointat your file structure.  

If you have set up everything correctly you should end up with a mod foder in your NO2 Mods subrirectory.

Clone the printscreen repository.

The repository contains two main subdirectories. One for the papyrus cade and one for the C++ code.  in these subdirectories you will need to update the file paths to match your system. 

The code uses a few Skryim Mods and you will need to download them. They are:
1. ConsleUtillsSSE NG 

2. SKSE
3.Address Library for SKSE
4. JContainers SE
Sky_UI
SkyUI_SDK

If all is correct you should be able to generate a set of files in the mod folder you specified in MO2.  Be sure to copy the interface folder to this directory. And that's all folks. Happy Modding.
